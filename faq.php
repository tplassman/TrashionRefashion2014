              <li>What information is required upon submission? You must have all of these components before submitting your design:</li>
              </strong>
              <ul type="square" style="list-style-position:inside">
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Phone number</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Detailed description of your garment</li>
                <li>Three images of your garment (front, back and detail)</li>
                <li>Model info.</li>
              </ul>
              <strong>
              <li>How much of my garment needs to be made of refashioned materials?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>90% of your garment needs to be of refashioned or discarded materials. Thread does not count.</span> <strong>
              <li>Can I use anything new in my design(s)?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Up to 10% of your garment made be new material, just so long as it&rsquo;s not a major component of your design. We encourage designers to use as much discarded and repurposed materials as possible in their designs.</span> <strong>
              <li>How many designs can I enter?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>We are allowing designers to enter up to three complete designs.</span> <strong>
              <li>Do I need to have a full &ldquo;look&rdquo; or can I submit just a skirt, top, or jacket?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>All entries must be a complete look. If you would like to be paired up with another designer to work together to complete a look, please contact<a href="mailto:bloomingtontrashion@gmail.com"> bloomingtontrashion@gmail.com</a>.</span> <strong>
              <li>Do I need to find my own model?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Designers are encouraged to have their own models, however, the Trashion/Refashion committee can help place a model in your design. You must note if you have a model and who they are in your submission process. If you need a model, that also must be noted. It is mandatory that you include the bust, waist, hips and length measurements of your garment with your submission if you need a model. Designers are responsible for communicating all requirements, commitments, and guidelines to their models and/or teams.</span> <strong>
              <li>What is the rehearsal time commitment?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>We divide rehearsals between the ReFashion group and the Trashion group, each have two rehearsals, approximately one hour each in the month before the event and one mandatory dress rehearsal the day of the event. Designers and models are required to attend all three rehearsals. During the rehearsals, we will ask that each model or guardian sign a consent for participation release for the event.</span> <strong>
              <li>What kind of designs show up best on stage?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Finished ones! Be bold, creative, and resourceful! This is a wild and exciting show, and the audience responds positively to different designs that are practical, bold, flashy, or creative. Designs that use impressive or unusual materials or a creative process also do really well. Please encourage your models to take their time on the runway to show off the design that they are wearing. It is very important that models do this for the show.</span> <strong>
              <li>Is there a prize for best design?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Bragging rights and positive attention, and the sound of wild applause that you will never forget.</span> <strong>
              <li>What criteria are used for judging designs?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Percentage of reused/discarded materials, complete design, complete application process including description.</span> <strong>
              <li>Who judges the designs?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>The Trashion Planning Committee will judge the design entries after the submission deadline.</span> <strong>
              <li>What is the difference between &ldquo;trashion&rdquo; and &ldquo;refashion&rdquo;?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Trashion is the result of creatively turning discarded items into fashion. Refashion is the result of modifying existing clothing into something more fashionable. If you have any questions, please contact<a href="mailto:bloomingtontrashion@gmail.com"> bloomingtontrashion@gmail.com</a></span> <strong>
              <li>If my design isn&rsquo;t finished by the submission deadline, can I submit an incomplete design or a proposal for a design?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>We must see an identifiable complete design by the submission deadline. If the design needs a few more tweaks and detail after the deadline has passed, the committee will allow it if the designer has made that clear in the submission application and has submitted evidence that the design is mostly completed.</span> <strong>
              <li>Do you supply hair and makeup services for the models and designers?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>We have teamed up with the Hair Arts Academy in years past to supply hair styles for the Trashion/ReFashion models. You may take advantage of this opportunity by arriving on time and signing in the day of the show, or you are welcome to supply your own hair stylist and/or make-up artist.  Designers are responsible for contacting their models and hair and MUA.</span> <strong>
              <li>Can I use my own makeup/hair stylists?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Absolutely. Space is limited behind the scenes at the theater, if you require a lot of space or materials to get ready, please consider arriving to the theater with as much hair and make-up finished as possible.</span> <strong>
              <li>What image file size and type is required for submission?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>We require three images with your submission application. 300 dpi, JPEG format </span><strong>
              <li>Can I request special music to be played during my model&rsquo;s time on the runway?</li>
              </strong> 
              <span>Sure. We reserve the right to maintain creative control, but if you have a suggestion to be played while your design is on the runway, please mention this in an email to<a href="mailto:bloomingtontrashion@gmail.com"> bloomingtontrashion@gmail.com</a> and we will pass the information on to our music supervisor.</span>
