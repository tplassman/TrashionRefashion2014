    <p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
    <p>The Trashion Refashion Show is open to all applicants regardless of age or gender. Work must have been executed within the last 3 years and not previously shown in a juried competition. Work must be constructed by the designer(s). If more than one person contributes to a design, the creators will be designated as co-designers. </p>
    <p>Designs should be full ensembles, if not, please consider donating them to the Discardia store or teaming up with another designer to complete an entire look. </p>
    <p>Up to 3 entries, in any combination of categories, may be submitted per designer or co-designers. </p>
    <p>A designer whose work is accepted should plan on attending the event on April 27th, 2014 at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater, as well as a two hour long rehearsals that will be scheduled in March or April 2014. </p>
    <p>Designers can wear their own design or supply a model. Youth designers should plan on wearing their own design or supplying a model. If you do not have a model, you must specify that information in your submission application so that we may find someone for you. You must include bust, waist, hips, and length measurements. </p>
    <p>Designs must be created from 90% recycled or previously used items. 10% can be purchased new to complete the design, but must not be a major component. We strongly encourage our designers to document the creation process, especially before, during and after photos. </p>
    <p><strong>Trashion</strong> is the result of creatively turning discarded items into fashion. <strong>Refashion</strong> is the result of modifying existing clothing into something more fashionable. </p>
    <p>When writing a description of your garment in the application, please keep in mind that this material will be used to write the script for the show. We ask that you please be as descriptive and informative as you can. We reserve the right to maintain creative control over the final script. Please tell us what the garment used to be and why you chose to make it into your final design. </p>
